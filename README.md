# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project ðŸš—ðŸ”‹

# Overview
This project analyzes a dataset related to Electric Vehicles (EVs) to uncover meaningful insights, conduct hypothesis testing, and provide actionable recommendations. The project is implemented using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

# Dataset Details
The dataset includes the following attributes:

Car Details: Name, Make, Model

Performance Metrics: Engine Power, Maximum Torque, Acceleration (0-100 kph), Top Speed

Physical Specifications: Dimensions (Wheelbase, Length, Width, Height), Weight, Boot Capacity, Tire Size

Energy Details: Battery Capacity, Energy Consumption, Maximum Charging Power, Driving Range

Other Attributes: Price, Drive Type, Number of Seats, Number of Doors

# Objectives and Tasks

## Task 1: Filtering and Aggregating EVs
Filter EVs within a budget of 350,000 PLN and a minimum range of 400 km.

Group them by manufacturer (Make) and calculate the average battery capacity for each.

## Task 2: Identifying Outliers
Detect outliers in the energy consumption (Mean - Energy consumption [kWh/100 km]).

## Task 3: Battery Capacity vs. Range
Visualize the relationship between battery capacity and range. 

Highlight key insights.
## Task 4: EV Recommendation System
Build a class that recommends the top 3 EVs based on user inputs for budget, desired range, and battery capacity.
## Task 5: Hypothesis Testing
Conduct a two-sample t-test to check for significant differences in engine power between Tesla and Audi vehicles.
## Task 6: Project Presentation
Create a video explaining the project's objectives, methodology, and findings. (Link included in the notebook.)
